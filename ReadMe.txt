The slash command is currently unused, but this addon provides a trivial
range finder for some units.  As of this writing, party1-party4, target,
focus, and targettarget.  It does not show a range finder for the player.
In theory, if it can't get the range, it should show "--".  Range is in
meters and is actually about as accurate as it looks.

Future options might include some sort of configuration, color coding,
fancy stuff like that.

As of this writing, THIS ADDON WILL ONLY WORK ON PTS.  Sorry.
